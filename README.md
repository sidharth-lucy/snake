# Snake Game 

The code is a Python implementation of the classic Snake Game using the Pygame library. 

The game window is created with a resolution of 900x600 pixels, and a caption "Snake Game". 
The snake is represented as a list of squares, where each square is 20x20 pixels, and its 
initial length is three squares. 

A square food appears on the screen at a random location, and the player's objective is to 
guide the snake to eat it by moving it around the screen. The player controls the snake's 
movement using the arrow keys, and the snake moves at a constant speed of 10 frames per second.

If the snake collides with the boundary of the game window or with itself, the game is over. 
The final score is displayed on the screen for five seconds before the game window closes. 

The game loop constantly updates the position of the snake's head and its body, checks for collisions,
and updates the position of the food. The score is incremented when the snake eats the food, and 
the length of the snake increases by one square. 

Overall, the code provides a basic implementation of the Snake Game using Pygame. It can be modified
and extended to add more features and complexity to the game.
